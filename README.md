# calculator-js

This code creates a simple calculator with two input fields for the numbers to operate on, and four buttons to perform the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. When the user clicks on any of these buttons, the corresponding JavaScript function is called to perform the operation and display the result in a separate input field. The `parseFloat()` function is used to convert the input values from strings to floating-point numbers before performing the calculations.
